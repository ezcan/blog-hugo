### Question
Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.
You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.
### Example
```
Given nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9,
Because nums[0] + nums[1] = 2 + 7 = 9,
return [0, 1].
```
### Thought

### Solution

```js
let solution = (arr, target) => {
  for(let i = 0; i < arr.length - 1; i++){
    let diff = target - arr[i]
    if(arr.includes(diff)){
      return [i, arr.lastIndexOf(diff)]
    }
  }
  return null
}
```
